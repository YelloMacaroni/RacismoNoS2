        <p>
          <br><br>
          It's a Sunday night, late at night and you forgot <br>
          to push your project which is due to the next day,<br>
          so you go to EPITA with the aim of finally pushing <br>
          this project, however, not everything is going as <br>
          expected, the malevolent spirit of an acdc that <br>
          would have disappeared a long time ago haunted the<br>
          place for a long time. The objective is to reach the <br>
          third floor while escaping the ghost (not so ghost) <br>
          in order to push his project. To do this, you will <br>
          have to succeed in overcoming the various obstacles, <br>
          solving puzzles and find the key objects to be able <br>
          to climb from floor to floor while avoiding this forgotten ACDC
